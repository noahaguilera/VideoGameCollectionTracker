### Week 1

1/24/2021

Tasks Completed:
* Set up coding environment
* Watch week 1 videos
* Complete week 1 exercise

This week was good for getting back into coding. I haven't coding in java for a few months now so the exercise was helpful to dip my toes back in without it being to much to handle. I had a few problems trying to set up the VM so I decided to challenge myself and try to use my personal enviroment and It's actually working out very well. I still have to think about what my Indie project is going to be.




### Week 2

1/31/2021

* Watch week 2 videos
* Complete week 2 activities and exercises
* Start setting up the project

This week I got a little more behind than I'd like, but hopefully I can bring it around this next week so I'm not saving my work till last minute. This week's activity was more robust than week 1, but I was expecting that. I think I did a good job on the exercise I included some things that weren't required like filtering the users in the database on first name as well as last name, and I displayed in a brief description what the user searched for on the result screen. Starting this journal this week and going forward seems really helpful to reflect on the work I completed and what I need to do going forward.
