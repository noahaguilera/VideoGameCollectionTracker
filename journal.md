### Week 1

1/24/2021

Tasks Completed:
* Set up coding environment
* Watch week 1 videos
* Complete week 1 exercise

This week was good for getting back into coding. I haven't coding in java for a few months now so the exercise was helpful to dip my toes back in without it being to much to handle. I had a few problems trying to set up the VM so I decided to challenge myself and try to use my personal enviroment and It's actually working out very well. I still have to think about what my Indie project is going to be.




### Week 2

1/31/2021

* Watch week 2 videos
* Complete week 2 activities and exercises
* Start setting up the project

This week I got a little more behind than I'd like, but hopefully I can bring it around this next week so I'm not saving my work till last minute. This week's activity was more robust than week 1, but I was expecting that. I think I did a good job on the exercise I included some things that weren't required like filtering the users in the database on first name as well as last name, and I displayed in a brief description what the user searched for on the result screen. Starting this journal this week and going forward seems really helpful to reflect on the work I completed and what I need to do going forward. 

### Week 3

2/9/2021

* Watched week 3 videos
* Wrote up my problem statement for my project
* Created the wireframes for my project
* Wrote up my user stories for mvp and not mvp
* Planed out my project for the rest of the semester

This week was not the best, I'm behind on the learning materials, but I'm going to make the effort to turn that around this week. However, I did make good progress on setting up my goals and vision for my project. Completing the project plan and the wireframes really helped me understand what needs to be done for the project, and the amount of time its going to take to complete that, which I didn't really have a good grasp on before doing it. Going forward I need to start taking the time to sit down and get the work done before the deadlines and not be scrambling to have enough time to finish.
