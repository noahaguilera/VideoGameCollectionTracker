# Noah Aguilera Individual Project


### Problem Statement

In recent years I've had trouble keeping track of all my games, which to me isn't a big surprise, because on the Xbox alone I have as of writing this 775 games, so across all of my systems through the years I have well over a thousand games. So keeping track of that many from memory would be almost impossible. 

So My solution to that would be to build a site to record your entire collection of games and specify if you own them digitally or physically and where they're currently located if they're in your house or in a storage locker for example.

Some features I would like to add is to auto import your xbox, steam, and playstation games so you don't have to do all the work of entering in the game info yourself. Also in the light I want to try and implement a barcode scanner so it can be easier to add games you have the box for.
